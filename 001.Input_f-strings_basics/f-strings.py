score=10

#if we want to print this out, like-
# print("Your score is " + str(score) + ", your height is " + str(height) + ", your winning is " + str(isWinning))
# so its very long and messy, so we will use f-strings
# we have to write f in front of a string to make it f-string

print(f"Your score is {score}, your height is {height}, your winning is {isWinning}")
# as you can see its simple, no need of pluses and type conversions
# different data types are used with strings in {}
